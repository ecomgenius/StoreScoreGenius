Step 3 – Ad Image Generation (AI-Powered)
✅ What the system must do:
Use the product image as base

Use OpenAI + vision capabilities to:

Generate a visual ad variant using that image

Add AI-generated text directly inside the image (not as output block)

Adapt layout to chosen format (1:1, 9:16, etc.)

Style image to reflect selected ad style (e.g., "Urgency" = red bold text overlays; "Premium" = clean, white, elegant fonts)

🎯 Output:

One downloadable image (PNG or JPG)

100% AI generated

Branded visually to match platform best practices

No call-to-action button (like Shop Now), unless user enables it explicitly

📦 OPTIONAL: AI Budget + Target Suggestion (if toggle enabled)
If the user enables this feature:

OpenAI generates:

Suggested audience targeting based on product category and input

Suggested daily budget + duration

Suggested platform behavior (e.g. better for IG story vs Facebook feed)

📤 Final Output
✅ One image file, ready to use on ad platforms

Download button (with format label)

Option to generate 2-3 variants from same input

Optional export to ad library

🧠 PROMPT STRATEGY FOR OPENAI (image + logic)
plaintext
Copy
Edit
You are a professional ad designer.  
Create a high-converting ad image for the product:  
"{product_title}"  
Use this description: {product_description}  
Style: {ad_style}  
Audience: {target_audience}  
Tone: {tone}  
Format: {format}  
Overlay compelling text inside the image. Make it suitable for {platform}.  
Base the image on this photo: {image_url}  
You can then pass this to DALL·E (if using OpenAI image gen), or GPT-4 with Vision if layering and layout is being AI-prompted into a canvas.
