Update the current app to return a structured and visually clear analysis result after scanning a Shopify or eBay store.

The output should include a visual score dashboard and detailed recommendations, divided into the following sections:

1. Overall Score Section (Top of the Page)

Calculate and return a total score from 0 to 100 based on weighted subcategories (below).

Display visually (progress bar or number inside a circle).

Also display 3 labels:

✅ What's working well

⚠️ What needs improvement

❌ What's critical or missing
