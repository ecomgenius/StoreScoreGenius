Extend the current SaaS app to support full user accounts, AI credit limits, payments, and store management features.

Here are the features and requirements to implement:

🔐 User Authentication & Database
Set up a PostgreSQL or MongoDB database to store users, stores, analysis history, credit usage, and subscriptions.

Implement registration & login (email + password) with session handling (JWT or cookies).

Allow users to save their scanned stores and see their history.

Each user can add multiple stores (eBay or Shopify) to be scanned later without retyping.

💳 Stripe Integration (with Free Trial & Subscription)
After registration, users are prompted to enter their credit card via Stripe Checkout.

Provide a 14-day free trial. Card is required upfront.

After the trial, charge $49/month via Stripe recurring subscription.

If the payment fails or subscription is canceled, revoke access to premium features.

Protect important results:

Blur or redact key data for users who are not subscribed.

Show a CTA: “Unlock full insights with your free trial — no charge for 14 days.”

🧠 AI Credit System
Give each new user 25 free AI credits (1 credit = 1 analysis or AI suggestion task).

After that, allow users to purchase additional credits via Stripe (e.g., $9 for 50 credits, $19 for 150, $39 for 500).

Deduct credits on each AI operation (e.g., store scan, AI product suggestion, AI design fix).

Store current credit count in the user database.

🛍️ Shopify Integration (Post-Login)
Let users connect their Shopify store via OAuth.

Once connected, AI should not only analyze but also offer real-time suggestions and improvements, such as:

Edit store layout or theme settings

Suggest & add new trending products

Help manage product titles, pricing, descriptions

Improve page speed and SEO using admin API

👑 Admin Panel
Create a secure /admin panel, accessible only to admin users (via role-based access).

Admin panel features:

View user list and email

See Stripe subscriptions and status

Total revenue and MRR

See store scan logs and usage

Adjust prices (subscription + credits)

Change free trial duration and credit limits

📦 Other Suggestions
Enable dark mode toggle

Add email notifications after each analysis (SendGrid or similar)

Create API endpoints to retrieve user stores, run scans, get usage stats

Set up rate limiting for guest users to prevent abuse

Include privacy policy & terms of service links during signup
