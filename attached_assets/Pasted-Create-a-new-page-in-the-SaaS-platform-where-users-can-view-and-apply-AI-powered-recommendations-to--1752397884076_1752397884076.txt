Create a new page in the SaaS platform where users can view and apply AI-powered recommendations to their connected Shopify store.

This page must include the following features and logic:

🧠 1. Display AI Recommendations
List all current AI-generated recommendations for the connected store.

Each recommendation should be expandable to show affected products.

Group them by type:

Improve product titles

Improve descriptions

Improve pricing

Add or fix keywords

✏️ 2. Allow AI-Powered Product Improvements
A. One-by-One Editing
When the user selects a single product, show:

Current title, description, pricing

AI-suggested version (side-by-side or toggle)

Button: “Apply suggestion (1 credit)”

On confirm, call the Shopify API to update the product

Deduct 1 AI credit from the user's balance

B. Bulk Improvement
Allow the user to apply suggestions in bulk by type (titles, descriptions, pricing, keywords).

Before applying, show a confirmation modal:

“This action will update all selected product fields. You won’t see individual previews. Continue?”

After confirmation:

Update all selected fields via Shopify API

Deduct 1 credit per product modified

Show a completion message with total credits used

💳 3. Credit System Integration
Every modification (whether individual or in bulk) consumes 1 credit per product.

If the user has insufficient credits:

Show a modal saying: “You need more AI credits to apply these changes. Buy more?”

Add link to Stripe credit purchase page (already integrated)

🔁 4. Optional Enhancements
Add filtering options (e.g., “Show only low-score products” or “Products missing descriptions”)

Add undo button for recent changes (last 5 mins) if feasible

Display last sync timestamp + button to re-fetch products

🧱 Tech requirements:
Frontend: React or Next.js component with clean UI (cards, modals, preview toggles)

Backend: API endpoints to:

Fetch AI suggestions per user/store

Apply changes to Shopify products via Shopify Admin API

Track credit usage and enforce limits
